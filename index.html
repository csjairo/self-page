      <h1>Jairo Holanda</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Man, Computer Scientist, and Intellectual Thinker.</p>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          I value what is concrete, functional, and built with one’s own hands.
          I am accustomed to manual work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in masculine tradition as discipline, responsibility,
          technical skill, and mastery of one’s craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value technical knowledge, logic, and structure. I like
          well-designed systems, clear processes, and simple solutions to real
          problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see work as a form of personal fulfillment and autonomy. Doing
          things well, with attention to detail, respect for time, and respect
          for the function of each thing — that is what I consider progress.
